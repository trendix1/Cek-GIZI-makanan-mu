GiziLearn — Vercel-ready (final)
==================================
This project is prepared to deploy to Vercel directly via Upload or GitHub import.

Before you deploy:
- Replace 'yourdomain.example' in index.html, sitemap.xml, manifest.json and README with your real domain.
- Replace admin email in contact page.
- Optionally replace ADSENSE-PLACEHOLDER in index.html with your AdSense script when approved.

Deploy steps:
1. Push to GitHub and import into Vercel OR upload this ZIP directly in Vercel's import flow.
2. Vercel will run `npm install` and `npm run build` (static files output into /dist).
3. After deploy, verify in Google Search Console and submit sitemap.xml.
